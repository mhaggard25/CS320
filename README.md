How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- Ensuring that my code is functional can be achieved by applying various testing techniques. I can inspect the inner workings of the code by using White Box testing. I can test the application by using Black Box testing which is a type of testing that allows the tester to test the application much like an end-user would.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- I interpret user needs by carefully reviewing any notes/interview transcripts carefully numerous times and taking quality notes on them. Then I review the notes and make a checklist and, as I develop my application, I check off the requirements as I meet them. 

How do I approach designing software?
- When designing software, I will, as stated above, review any notes/transcripts and begin planning for the application. I start with an informal set of notes that detail what I need to do and when it needs to be accomplished. As I continue to plan and revise, my informal set of notes evolves into a System Design Document detailing the requirments of the application. I then begin building diagrams, such as a class diagram, to aid in planning and structure. After the planning phase of the design process finalizes, I will begin writing code. Throughout the process of writing the application, I can revisit my planing documents and make changes if necessary to better suit the project.
